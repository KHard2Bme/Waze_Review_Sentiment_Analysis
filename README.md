# Project Overview
---
I will be performing an App Review Sentiment Analysis on the Waze mobile app dataset so as to evaluate and understand the sentiments expressed in user reviews over a 15 year span; 2009 through 2023.</b> 

I will use data analysis techniques to determine whether the sentiments in these reviews are positive, negative, or neutral.</b>

I will also perform Exploratory Data Analysis on the dataset to answer a few questions derived along the way.</b>


 >note: The App Review Sentiment Analysis and EDA steps will be shown in detail within the Jupyter Notebook.


# Python Libraries Used
---
*pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlip, datetime


# Data Sources
---

The primary dataset used for this analysis is the "WAZE_REVIEWS.csv" file obtained from Kaggle which contains 780,073 rows and 9 columns.<br>

The dataset covers user reviews regarding the Waze mobile app during the years 2009 through 2023.<br>

# Exploratory Data Analysis
---
<p>
In my analysis I explore and answer the following questions:

1. From the distribution of ratings chart, which rating has the most reviews? Least reviews?
2. From the distribution of sentiments chart, what are the number of reviews for each sentiment?
3. Based off the findings from the sentiment distribution across ratings chart, the negative sentiment is at its highest in rating number 1. How many reviews make up this sentiment?

### <h3 align="center">App Review Sentiments Analysis:<h3/>
-  I will perform a text analysis of the waze_data dataset to identify common words or themes within each sentiment category.
-  The analysis involves examining the most frequently occurring words in positive, negative, and neutral reviews using a word cloud.<br><br>


</p>


<p>  

 
4. Based off the findings from the distribution of author apps versions chart, which version has the most reviews and which has the least?
5. Based off the findings from the sentiment distribution across apps chart, version 4.73.0.3 has more negative sentiments than version 3.9.4.0. How many negative reviews are in this sentiment? How many negative reviews are in 3.9.4.0?

### <h3 align="center">App Review Sentiments Analysis:<h3/>
-  I will perform a text analysis on both author app versions 4.73.0.3 and 3.9.4.0 to identify common words or themes within the negative sentiment category.<br><br>



</p>

  
  
6. Based off the findings from the distribution of years for reviews chart, which three years contained the most reviews and which year had the least amount of reviews overall?
7. Based off the findings from the sentiment distribution by year chart, the year with the most negative sentiments is 2021. How many negative reviews have  been placed and the percentage out of all negative sentiments? How many negative reviews are from author app versions 4.73.0.3 and 3.9.4.0? 
8.  Based off the findings from the year distribution by ratings chart, we see that in rating number 1 there is a large percent of reviews from year 2021 than any other year. How many reviews make up the positive, negative and neutral sentiments? How many negative reviews are from author app versions 4.73.0.3 and 3.9.4.0?
