# Project Overview
---
I will be performing an App Review Sentiment Analysis on the Waze mobile app dataset so as to evaluate and understand the sentiments expressed in user reviews over a 15 year span; 2009 through 2023.</b> 

I will use data analysis techniques to determine whether the sentiments in these reviews are positive, negative, or neutral.</b>

I will also perform Exploratory Data Analysis on the dataset to answer a few questions derived along the way.</b>


 >note: The App Review Sentiment Analysis and EDA steps will be shown in detail within the Jupyter Notebook.


# Python Libraries Used
---
*pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlip, datetime


# Data Sources
---

The primary dataset used for this analysis is the "WAZE_REVIEWS.csv" file obtained from Kaggle which contains 780,073 rows and 9 columns.<br>

The dataset covers user reviews regarding the Waze mobile app during the years 2009 through 2023.<br>


# App Review Sentiments Analysis
---
### Lets first explore the dataset by analyzing the distribution of ratings. It will provide insight into the overall sentiment of the reviews.<br>

### As you can see, the above distribution of ratings chart gives you a clear picture of how many reviews fall into each rating category (from 1 to 5).

### Lets now explore this dataset by analyzing the distribution of sentiments. It will give us a basic understanding of the general sentiment tendency in the reviews.<br>

### In addition to the app having high ratings, reviewers also had many positive words in the reviews for the app.

### Lets now explore the relationship between the sentiments and the ratings. This analysis can help us understand whether there is a correlation between the sentiment of the text and the numerical rating. For this task, we can see how sentiments are distributed across different rating levels.

### As you can see, most of the positive reviews fall within rating number 5 while most of the negative reviews fall within rating number 1.

## There is definetly a correlation between the high amount of reviews placed within rating number 5 and the amount of reviews placed within the positive sentiment.

### Letâ€™s perform a text analysis of the waze_data dataset to identify common words or themes within each sentiment category.

### As you can see, there are alot of positive words used in the review text for the positive sentiment.


# Exploratory Data Analysis
---
<p>
In my analysis I explore and answer the following questions:

1. From the distribution of ratings chart, which rating has the most reviews? Least reviews?
2. From the distribution of sentiments chart, what are the number of reviews for each sentiment? Which has the most reviews?
3. Based off the findings from the sentiment distribution across ratings chart, the negative sentiment is at its highest in rating number 1. How many reviews make up this sentiment?
4. Based off the findings from the distribution of author apps versions chart, which version has the most reviews and which has the least?
5. Based off the findings from the sentiment distribution across apps chart, version 4.73.0.3 has more negative sentiments than version 3.9.4.0. How many negative reviews are in this sentiment? How many negative reviews are in 3.9.4.0?

### <h3 align="center">App Review Sentiments Analysis:<h3/>
-  I will perform a text analysis on both author app versions 4.73.0.3 and 3.9.4.0 to identify common words or themes within the negative sentiment category.<br><br>



</p>
  
6. Based off the findings from the distribution of years for reviews chart, which three years contained the most reviews and which year had the least amount of reviews overall?
7. Based off the findings from the sentiment distribution by year chart, the year with the most negative sentiments is 2021. How many negative reviews have  been placed and the percentage out of all negative sentiments? How many negative reviews are from author app versions 4.73.0.3 and 3.9.4.0? 
8.  Based off the findings from the year distribution by ratings chart, we see that in rating number 1 there is a large percent of reviews from year 2021 than any other year. How many reviews make up the positive, negative and neutral sentiments? How many negative reviews are from author app versions 4.73.0.3 and 3.9.4.0?

# Results From Findings


I originaly chose this dataset so that i could perform a Sentiment Analysis on opinions expressed in the text, to determine viewer's attitude towards the Waze mobile app, but after spending time performing an exploratory data analysis on the data I discovered a few interesting facts regarding app versions and years the reviews were submitted by.

Based on the waze mobile app dataset we can tell that most of the user reviews have a very positive sentiment and are ranked within rating number 5.

Based on the two author apps reviewed, 3.9.4.0 has twice the amount of reviews than 4.73.0.3, but version 4.73.0.3 has four times the amount of negative review sentiments.

About 23% of the negative sentiments were placed in year 2021 with 41% coming from author app version 4.73.0.3 and 9% from version 3.9.4.0.

Of the negative sentiments placed in year 2021, those ranked in rating number 1 were 39%.

Of those ranked in rating number 1, 41% came from author app version 4.73.0. while 9% came from author app version 3.9.4.0.

Most of the reviews were made during 2014 through 2017.
